# Install software on your computer


### Install [git](http://git-scm.com/).

You have it installed if you can run `git --version` at the command
line and get output like `git version 2.3.5`.


### Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads).

There are two things you can verify to check your install.

First, from the command line, all of the following should start up
some kind of Python interpreter:

```bash
python
ipython
ipython notebook
spyder
```

Second, inside any of those Python interpreters, you should be able to
do all of these without error:

```python
import numpy
import scipy
import matplotlib
import pandas
import statsmodels
import sklearn
```

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) on Mac

If you use a Mac, install Homebrew if you don't
have it yet. You could use Homebrew to manage your `git` and `python`
installs as well, but the methods given above are very good and more
cross-platform.

###Q1. Python Version 2 or 3

**Course material for the bootcamp is compatible with Python versions 2.7 and 3.0. Python 3 is recommended and encouraged.**  

Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why?  

>> Python 3.  Python 2.7 came pre-installed on the machine but I downloaded Python 3.6 since that is what is recommended.
I started my Python training with 2.7 but have been using 3 for a few weeks now so am getting comfortable with the differences.

###Q2. Which Python Version Installed   

>> To check what version of Python is on a machine, type python --version from a Command Prompt in Terminal (or whatever
the appropriate command window is for the given operating system).  If Python3 is also on the machine,
you need to tyoe python3 --version to see which version is installed.  On my machine, both versions are installed.
